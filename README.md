# Maze Solver

This project is an adaptation of the age-old routing problem. This CSCI204 project was broken into two phases, which allowed us to test two different implementations. For Phase 1, the implementation of choice was recursion, but this was often computationally difficult as a new maze had to be created each time. During Phase 2, we were able to use a stack. While the concept was largly the same, the implementation and the resultant output was a bit different. The difference in shell output can be noticed [here.](./docs/)
